### Core Features

1. **Dynamic E-commerce Search**: After user input, Initiate a Laptop search on Amazon and Daraz.

2. **Automated Price Comparison**: The scraper automates laptop searches and compares prices across multiple listings.

3. **Airflow Workflow**: Integrated with Apache Airflow for scheduled and automated execution.

4. **Data Storage**: Extracted laptop details and prices are stored in a structured format.

## Project Process

This repository contains the code and configuration for the Laptop Scraper project. The workflow involves initiating a search on e-commerce platforms, extracting first page laptop details, and comparing prices. The process is orchestrated using Airflow for automation.

### 1. E-commerce Search

- User enter its desired laptop name, Initiating a Laptop search on Amazon and Daraz (Only first page).

### 2. Web Scraping

- Python scripts leverage Requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping to extract laptop details and prices from both platforms.

### 3. Data Comparison (ETL)

- Extracted data is compared to identify the laptop with the lowest price.
- We compare data of both platforms, Converting Currency and other relevant parameters and store in MongoDb.

### 4. Airflow Integration

- Airflow is configured to automate the entire process at scheduled intervals.

## Technology Stack

- **Web Scraping**: Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup)
- **Automation**: Apache Airflow
- **Data Storage**: Structured format for extracted data (MongoDb)
