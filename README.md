### Core Features

1. **Dynamic E-commerce Search**: Users input laptop specifications, initiating a search on Amazon or Daraz.

2. **Automated Price Comparison**: The scraper automates laptop searches and compares prices across multiple listings.

3. **Airflow Workflow**: Integrated with Apache Airflow for scheduled and automated execution.

4. **Data Storage**: Extracted laptop details and prices are stored in a structured format.

## Project Process

This repository contains the code and configuration for the Laptop Scraper project. The workflow involves initiating a search on selected e-commerce platforms, extracting relevant laptop details, and comparing prices. The process is orchestrated using Airflow for automation.

### 1. E-commerce Search

- Users provide input criteria for the desired laptop (e.g., brand, specifications).

### 2. Web Scraping

- Python scripts leverage Requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping to extract laptop details and prices.

### 3. Data Comparison

- Extracted data is compared to identify the laptop with the lowest price.

### 4. Airflow Integration

- Airflow is configured to automate the entire process at scheduled intervals.

### 5. Data Storage

- MongoDb is used to Store Transformed Data.
